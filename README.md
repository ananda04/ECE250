This repository contains some of my work for ECE 250: Computer Architecture taught at Duke by Prof. Sorin.

Homework 1: 3 simple programing projects in C including writing "Hello World!", squaring numbers, and writing a welcome program

Homework 2: Not Included in this REPO (learning linux commands)

Homework 3: Involved writing an insertion sort algorithm in C to sort a list a golfers by name and par value  

Homework 4: Involved writing an insertion sort algorithm in MIPS assembly to sort a list a golfers by name and par value  

Homework 5: Inlcuded 4 different projects including simulating two smaller circuits in Logisim, a full adder, and a hardware Finite State Machine (FSM) for a robot arm

Homework 6: A single-core CPU which runs MIPS assembly. Includes hardware such as Program Counters, ALU, Register Files, RAM, and ROM.

Homework 7: Created a C program to simulate a cache based on a configuration provided through the command line. The configuration includes the name of the file containing load and store commands, the cache size in KB, the associativity, and the block size in bytes. The program should process the commands from the file, simulate the cache behavior, and output to the console whether each load or store operation results in a hit or a miss.
